# JSSnippets

These are just some utility functions that make working with HTML, CSS, and JS easier.

Functions:

# generateHTML
  The 'generateHTML' function generates an html element through Javascript
in a more visually friendly way for those that don't like document.createElement() trees.
Allows for easy Nesting of HTML Elements and better control over the elements themselves through template literals.
